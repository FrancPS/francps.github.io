                <div style="width: 65%;">
                    <p>Hello, a pleasure to meet you!</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>My name is Franc Porta, I'm 27 and I currently live in Barcelona.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I just love making games.</p>
                    <p>Be it that sensation when you are building a world that you can see and interact with.</p>
                    <p>Be it the satisfaction of solving something that felt impossible to solve.</p>
                    <p>Be it just being part of this amazing array of universes that exist in the virtual world and in our imagination, where we can be heroes, princesses, world destroyers and cooks. Anything is possible here!</p>
                    <br>
                    <h2 style="line-height: 1.5em;">This is my story as a game dev</h2>
                    <p>It all began in one of those nights when you cannot sleep. I had recently started at the Uni, but I was dissatisfied with almost everything I was doing there.</p>
                    <p>I was wondering about my future, my passions, what would become of me as I grew up.</p>
                    <p>And at that moment I made the decision. It all connected... I wanted to be a Game Designer.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>So I started my path. I left everything behind and I decided to study Computer Engineering, to have a broad knowledge about computers and programming, with the goal of getting to do a Master's in some video games specialization.</p>
                    <p>And I did. In the best place possible. I couldn't imagine the great adventure it would be to be part of that amazing class, working hand-to-hand in a project that our teachers and ourselves would be proud of.</p>
                    <p>You would say it was an academic project. To me, I've never felt more proud of something in my life since then.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>And now, I can't stop. And this is just weeks ago now.</p>
                    <p>I've embarked on an indie (I mean 'secret') project with 5 amazing people, started looking for game jams and begun some personal projects related to gaming.</p>
                    <p>I just can't wait to give back something to the industry that gave and still gives me so much.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>And who knows what the future holds...</p>
